#### **Extras Not Currently in the app**

-->This were stretches, and due to the time constraints on the projet I was unable to reach them. However, this project was a great deal of fun, and as I grow in my knowledge of full stack dev, I plan to revisit this application and try to implement all of these extras.
Search feature to search by animal type
Link to display all the animal profiles on the site
Ability to signup with a public account just to view animals, and possilby apply to adopt a new critter
Ability for animal organizations to accept/solicit donations with a button feature that will link to a 3rd party API
Switch all forms to modals
