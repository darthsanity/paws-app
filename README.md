#### **Extras Not Currently in the app**

-->These were stretches, and due to the time constraints on the projet I was unable to reach them. However, this project was a great deal of fun, and as I grow in my knowledge of full stack dev, I plan to revisit this application and try to implement all of these extras
>Search feature to search by animal type<br>
>Link to display all the animal profiles on the site<br>
>Ability to signup with a public account just to view animals, and possilby apply to adopt a new critter<br>
>Ability for animal organizations to accept/solicit donations with a button feature that will link to a 3rd party API<br>
>Switch all forms to modals
